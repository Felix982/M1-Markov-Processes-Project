# M1-Markov-Processes-Project
This is a project made in the scope of the Markov Processes course of the first year of my masters degree in colaboration with Eoin Hanrahan. Our task was to choose or build a Markov Jump Process, simulate it, prove a property of this process mathematically and show that it also holds in the case of simulations.
